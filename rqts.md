Time series are sometimes quantized, for example in order to save memory. For coarse quantization, this means that we lose quite a lot of information - or does it?
Attempting to reconstruct the blue curve using only the orange curve seems like an ill-defined problem, and in general, it is. But practically, we might be able to do quite well.  \
Analogously to the need of an inductive bias in machine learning, reconstruction requires a bias too: Given the quantized signal, there is an infinite number of possible reconstructions, and we need to specify a preference for some of them over others. We can do this by assuming a model class for the original time series, for example an autoregressive model:
$$x_t = \sum_{i=1}^p \phi_i x_{t-i}+w_i, \quad w_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$$
